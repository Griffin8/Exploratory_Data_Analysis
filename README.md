#course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

##Requirements:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Data sources:
* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

##Results:
* README.md -- this file
* CodeBook.md -- describes the variables, the data, and any transformations
* run_analysis.R -- R script to transform data sources to tidydata.txt
* tidydata.txt -- tidy dataset
